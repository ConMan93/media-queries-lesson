4. Talk about Extraction (Desktop to mobile design philosophy) vs Enhancement (Mobile first to desktop philosophy)

Extraction:

-Developing desktop view and working down to mobile views 
-This way tends to lead to a feature rich desktop view which may be hard to scale down to mobile views 
-May try to cram features from desktop view to mobile views to keep same features and feel 
-Can lead to a mobile view that feels like an afterthought rather than a well thoguht out app

Enhancement: 

-Developing for mobile first 
-Build in the most critical and needed features 
    -Take into account device capabilities 
-Build up to desktop view 
    -Add in more/better features as device is more powerful/has better capabilities
-Starting with mobile tends to lead to views/features that are well designed for all platforms/views 

5. Let students know trend is mobile first but you can go with either approach.

6. Responsive design. Briefly introduce the concept of making a site change it's appearance based on the size of the screen.

9. Move into transitions 
9.1 Explain transitions do not handle the starting or ending values for css properties. Transitions dont change css properties, they just define how long it takes for the animation to change
9.2 Transitions cannot loop like animations can 
9.3 Transitions must be triggered to run by click, hover e.t.c 
9.4 Build out transitions in Animation component 
9.5 If time after all of this build out a simple web page with a dropdown and a header / some body stuff
